                        </h3>
                        <p>Apart from these, there are even some Alaska Airlines Ticket Cancellation Policy rules that
                            may apply to your booking on cancellation. Therefore, you need to keep these points in mind
                            before you actually cancel your flight booking.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Firstly, a passenger may cancel his ticket before the flightâ€™s scheduled departure.</li>
                            <li>If you are not eligible for a refund, you can still cancel your Alaska Airlines booking
                                and get the value as flight credit. This value can be used for your future travel and
                                will be equivalent to your initial fare.</li>
                            <li>Suppose you have purchased the flight ticket from a third party like a travel agent or
                                any website.</li>
                            <li>In that case, you need to directly get in touch with them for canceling your flights and
                                refund process.</li>
                            <li>Furthermore, the airline will refund your cash tickets within 20 business days. And if
                                they are credit card purchases, you will get a refund within seven business days.</li>
                            <li>However, as per the cancellation policy of Alaska airlines, you may be prepared to see
                                them in your account within 14 business days.</li>
                            <li>The airline will physically inspect refunds for paper tickets. Therefore, you may bring
                                it from where you purchased or mail it to the official mailing address of Alaska
                                Airlines.</li>

                                which you can identify by a 13-digit ticket number starting with 027 (Alaska Airlines
                                code).</li>
                            <li>If your ticket is issued by another airline and does not start with 027, it will be
                                subject to the other airlineâ€™s policy (with or without exemption).</li>
